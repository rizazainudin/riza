About Me
My name is Jay Sueno and I'm a novice data scientist with a certificate from UC San Diego in Data Science and Visualization. I believe that artifical intelligence and machine learning are the next industrial revolution and can be a cause for good in the world. It's up to humans like you and me to guide that future.

One of the paradigms I ascribe to is intersectional activism to solve the challenges of our world. Climate change, inequality, environmental justice, technology, education, race, and human ingenuity are interconnected. I believe that through data we can find patterns and educate ourselves to choose the best decisions.
