# Hey! 👋

### About me
My name is [Riza Zainudin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/riza-zainudin/) and I am a full-time data analyst with a certificate from [The Center of Applied Data Science (CADS)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/thecads/), I have completed a data analyst track training last February 2021. I believe that data tells us more than just numbers, it helps us to understand our users and their desires.

🌱 I’m aiming to progress my career, and I'm seeking opportunities in maximizing my potential and developing new skills related to data science and analytics. I'm motivated by digging into data. Give me a spreadsheet and questions, and I'm eager to figure out what's driving the numbers. Being able to provide that essential information is really motivating.
